# Contributing

To contribute, first add the image(s) to the root directory (this may be changed at a later date) and make sure the filename of the image is uwu'ified (for example, arch becomes nyarch).

Then append your image to the README.MD file, adding in an entry to the contents at the top, and then the section with your image at the bottom. Please provide source and license if possible. Styleguide should be obvious, just copy a previous segment and ammend the information.
